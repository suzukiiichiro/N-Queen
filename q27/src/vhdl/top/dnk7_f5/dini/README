The modules contained within this directory tree have been implemented by
the DINI Group as part of the reference design for their DNK7_F5_PCIe
Algorithm Acceleration board.

These modules implement the host communication backbone also used by this
implementation of a Q27 Solver. They are used and included in this open-source
project by the greatly appreciated permission of the DINI Group.
